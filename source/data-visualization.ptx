        <title>Visualizing data distributions</title>
        
        <introduction>
          <p>Summarizing complex datasets is crucial in data analysis, allowing us to share insights drawn from the data more effectively. One common method is to use the <em>average</em> value to summarize a list of numbers. For instance, a high school's quality might be represented by the average score in a standardized test. Sometimes, an additional value, the <em>standard deviation</em>, is added. So, a report might say the scores were 680 <m>\pm</m> 50, boiling down a full set of scores to just two numbers. But is this enough? Are we overlooking crucial information by relying solely on these summaries instead of the complete data?</p>
          
          <p>Our first data visualization building block is learning to summarize lists of numbers or categories. More often than not, the best way to share or explore these summaries is through data visualization. The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its distribution. Once data has been summarized as a distribution, there are several data visualization techniques to effectively relay this information. For this reason, it is important to have a deep understanding of the concept of a distribution.</p>
          
          <p>In this chapter, we discuss properties of a variety of distributions and how to visualize distributions using a motivating example of student heights.</p>
        </introduction>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-variable-types">
          <title>Variable types</title>
          
          <p>The two main variables types are <em>categorical</em> and <em>numeric</em>. Each can be divided into two other groups: categorical can be ordinal or not, whereas numerical variables can be discrete or continuous. When entries in a dataset represent groups rather than numbers we refer to the data as <em>categorical data</em>. Two simple examples are sex (male or female) and US regions (Northeast, South, North Central, West). Some categorical data can be ordered even if they are not numbers per se, such as spiciness (mild, medium, hot). In statistics, ordered categorical data are referred to as <em>ordinal</em> data. Examples of numerical data are population sizes, murder rates, and heights. We can further divide numerical data into continuous and discrete. Continuous variables are those that can take any value, such as heights, if measured with enough precision. For example, a pair of twins may be 68.12 and 68.11 inches, respectively. Counts, such as population sizes, are discrete because they have to be round numbers.</p>
          
          <p>Keep in mind that discrete numeric data can be considered ordinal. Although this is technically true, we usually reserve the term ordinal data for variables belonging to a small number of different groups, with each group having many members. In contrast, when we have many groups with few cases in each group, we typically refer to them as discrete numerical variables. So, for example, the number of packs of cigarettes a person smokes a day, rounded to the closest pack, would be considered ordinal, while the actual number of cigarettes would be considered a numerical variable. But, indeed, there are examples that can be considered both numerical and ordinal when it comes to visualizing data.</p>
          
          <p>Here we focus on numeric variables because visualizing this data type is substantially more complex. However, we start by describing data visualization and summarization approaches for categorical data.</p>

        <section xml:id="sec-case-study-heights">
          <title>Case study: describing student heights</title>
          
          <p>We introduce a new motivating problem. It is an artificial one, but it will help us illustrate the concepts needed to understand distributions.</p>
          
          <p>Pretend that we have to describe the heights of our classmates to ET, an extraterrestrial that has never seen humans. As a first step, we need to collect data. To do this, we ask students to report their heights in inches. We ask them to provide sex information because we know there are two different height distributions by sex. We collect the data and save it in the <c>heights</c> data frame:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
head(heights)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>One way to convey the heights to ET is to simply send him this list of 1,050 heights. But there are much more effective ways to convey this information, and understanding the concept of a distribution will be key. To simplify the explanation, we first focus on male heights. We examine the female height data later in this chapter.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-distributions">
          <title>Distributions</title>
          
          <p>The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers is its <em>distribution</em>. The simplest way to think of a distribution is as a compact description of a list with many entries. This concept should not be new for readers of this book. For example, with categorical data, the distribution simply describes the proportion of each unique category. The sex represented in the heights dataset is:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
prop.table(table(heights$sex))
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>This two-category <em>frequency table</em> is the simplest form of a distribution. We don't really need to visualize it since one number describes everything we need to know: 23% are females and the rest are males. When there are more categories, then a simple barplot describes the distribution. Here is an example with US state regions:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders |> group_by(region) |>
  summarize(n = n()) |>
  mutate(Proportion = n/sum(n), 
         region = reorder(region, Proportion)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=region, y=Proportion, fill=region)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) + 
  xlab("")
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>This particular plot simply shows us four numbers, one for each category. We usually use barplots to display a few numbers. Although this particular plot does not provide much more insight than a frequency table itself, it is a first example of how we convert a vector into a plot that succinctly summarizes all the information in the vector. When the data is numerical, the task of displaying distributions is more challenging.</p>
          
          <subsection xml:id="subsec-histograms">
            <title>Histograms</title>
            
            <p>Numerical data that are not categorical also have distributions. However, in general, when data is not categorical, reporting the frequency of each entry, as we did for categorical data, is not an effective summary since most entries are unique. For example, in our case study, while several students reported a height of 68 inches, only one student reported a height of 68.503937007874 inches and only one student reported a height 68.8976377952756 inches. We assume that they converted from 174 and 175 centimeters, respectively.</p>
            
            <p>Statistics textbooks teach us that a more useful way to define a distribution for numeric data is to define a function that reports the proportion of the data below <m>a</m> for all possible values of <m>a</m>. This function is called the empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF), it can be plotted, and it provides a full description of the distribution of our data. Here is the eCDF for male student heights:</p>
            
            <program language="r">
              <input>
ds_theme_set()
heights |> filter(sex=="Male") |> 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  stat_ecdf() +
  ylab("Proportion of heights less than or equal to a") + 
  xlab("a")
              </input>
            </program>
            
            <p>However, summarizing data by plotting the eCDF is actually not very popular in practice. The main reason is that it does not easily convey characteristics of interest such as: at what value is the distribution centered? Is the distribution symmetric? What ranges contain 95% of the values?</p>
            
            <p><em>Histograms</em> are much preferred because they greatly facilitate answering such questions. Histograms sacrifice just a bit of information to produce plots that are much easier to interpret. The simplest way to make a histogram is to divide the span of our data into non-overlapping bins of the same size. Then, for each bin, we count the number of values that fall in that interval. The histogram plots these counts as bars with the base of the bar defined by the intervals. Here is the histogram for the height data splitting the range of values into one inch intervals: <m>(49.5, 50.5]</m>, <m>(50.5, 51.5]</m>, <m>(51.5,52.5]</m>, <m>(52.5,53.5]</m>, <m>...</m>, <m>(82.5,83.5]</m>.</p>
            
            <program language="r">
              <input>
heights |> 
  filter(sex=="Male") |> 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black")
              </input>
            </program>
            
            <p>As you can see in the figure above, a histogram is similar to a barplot, but it differs in that the x-axis is numerical, not categorical.</p>
            
            <p>If we send this plot to ET, he will immediately learn some important properties about our data. First, the range of the data is from 50 to 84 with the majority (more than 95%) between 63 and 75 inches. Second, the heights are close to symmetric around 69 inches. Also, by adding up counts, ET could obtain a very good approximation of the proportion of the data in any interval. Therefore, the histogram above is not only easy to interpret, but also provides almost all the information contained in the raw list of 812 male heights with about 30 bins.</p>
            
            <p>What information do we lose? Note that all values in each interval are treated the same when computing bin heights. So, for example, the histogram does not distinguish between 64, 64.1, and 64.2 inches. Given that these differences are almost unnoticeable to the eye, the practical implications are negligible and we were able to summarize the data to just 23 numbers.</p>
            
            <p>We discuss how to code histograms later in this chapter.</p>
          </subsection>
          
          <subsection xml:id="subsec-smoothed-density">
            <title>Smoothed density</title>
            
            <p><em>Smooth density</em> plots relay the same information as a histogram but are aesthetically more appealing. Here is what a smooth density plot looks like for our male heights data:</p>
            
            <program language="r">
              <input>
heights |> 
  filter(sex=="Male") |> 
  ggplot(aes(height)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .2, fill= "#00BFC4", color = 0)  +
  geom_line(stat='density')
              </input>
            </program>
            
            <p>In this plot, we no longer have sharp edges at the interval boundaries and many of the local peaks have been removed. Also, the scale of the y-axis changed from counts to <em>density</em>. To fully understand smooth densities, we have to understand <em>estimates</em>, a topic covered in statistics our advanced data science textbooks. Here we simply describe them as making the histograms prettier by drawing a curve that goes through the top of the histogram bars and then removing the bars. The values shown y-axis are chosen so that the area under the curve adds up to 1. This implies that for any interval, the area under the curve for that interval gives us an approximation of how what proportion of the data is in the interval.</p>
            
            <p>An advantage of smooth densities over histograms for visualization purposes is that densities make it easier to compare two distributions. This is in large part because the jagged edges of the histogram add clutter. Here is an example comparing male and female heights:</p>
            
            <program language="r">
              <input>
heights |> 
  ggplot(aes(height, fill=sex)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, color = 0) +
  geom_line(stat='density')
              </input>
            </program>
            
            <p>With the right argument, <c>ggplot</c> automatically shades the intersecting region with a different color. We will show examples of <alert>ggplot2</alert> code for densities later in this book.</p>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-normal-distribution">
            <title>The normal distribution</title>
            
            <p>Histograms and density plots provide excellent summaries of a distribution. But can we summarize even further? We often see the average and standard deviation used as summary statistics: a two-number summary! To understand what these summaries are and why they are so widely used, we need to understand the normal distribution.</p>
            
            <p>The normal distribution, also known as the bell curve and as the Gaussian distribution. Here is what the normal distribution looks like:</p>
            
            <program language="r">
              <input>
mu &lt;- 0; s &lt;- 1
norm_dist &lt;- data.frame(x=seq(-4,4,len=50)*s+mu) |> mutate(density=dnorm(x,mu,s))
norm_dist |> ggplot(aes(x,density)) + geom_line()
              </input>
            </program>
            
            <p>The normal distribution is one of the most famous mathematical concepts in history. A reason for this is that the distribution of many datasets can be approximated with normal distributions. These include gambling winnings, heights, weights, blood pressure, standardized test scores, and experimental measurement errors. Statistical textbooks offer explanations for why this is the case. But how can the same distribution approximate datasets with completely different ranges for values, for example heights and weights? A second important characteristic of the normal distribution is that it can be adapted to different datasets by just adjusting two numbers, referred to as the <em>average</em> or <em>mean</em> and the <em>standard deviation</em> (SD). The normal distribution is symmetric, centered at what we refer to as the average, and most values (about 95%) are within 2 SDs from the average. The plot above shows a normal distribution with average 0 and SD 1, often referred to as a <em>standard normal</em>. Note that the fact that only two numbers are needed to adapt the normal distribution to a dataset implies that if our data distribution is approximated by a normal distribution, all the information needed to describe the distribution can be encoded by just two numbers. We now define these values for an arbitrary list of numbers.</p>
            
            <p>Once we are convinced that our data, say it is stored in the vector <c>x</c>, has a distribution that is <em>approximately normal</em>, we can find the specific one that matches our data by matching the average and SD of the data to the average and SD of the normal distribution, respectively. For a list of numbers contained in a vector <c>x</c>:</p>
            
            <program language="r">
              <input>
index &lt;- heights$sex == "Male"
x &lt;- heights$height[index]
              </input>
            </program>
            
            <p>the average is defined as</p>
            
            <program language="r">
              <input>
m &lt;- sum(x) / length(x)
              </input>
            </program>
            
            <p>and the SD is defined as</p>
            
            <program language="r">
              <input>
s &lt;- sqrt(sum((x - mu)^2) / length(x))
              </input>
            </program>
            
            <p>which can be interpreted as the average distance between values and their average.</p>
            
            <p>The pre-built functions <c>mean</c> and <c>sd</c> (note that, for reasons explained in statistics textbooks, <c>sd</c> divides by <c>length(x)-1</c> rather than <c>length(x)</c>) can be used here:</p>
            
            <program language="r">
              <input>
m &lt;- mean(x)

        <section xml:id="sec-boxplots">
          <title>Boxplots</title>
          
          <p>To understand boxplots we need to define some terms that are commonly used in exploratory data analysis.</p>
          
          <p>The <em>percentiles</em> are the values for which <m>p = 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99</m> of the data are less then or equal to that value, respectively. We call, for example, the case of <m>p=0.10</m> the 10th percentile, which gives us a number for which 10% of the data is below. The most famous percentile is the 50th, also known as the <em>median</em>. Another special case that receives a name are the <em>quartiles</em>, which are obtained when setting <m>p=0.25,0.50</m>, and <m>0.75</m>, which are used by the boxplot.</p>
          
          <p>To motivate boxplots we will go back to the US murder data. Suppose we want to summarize the murder rate distribution. Using the data visualization technique we have learned, we can quickly see that the normal approximation does not apply here:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders &lt;- murders |> mutate(rate = total/population*100000)
murders |> ggplot(aes(x = rate)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = "black") + ggtitle("Histogram")
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>In this case, the histogram above or a smooth density plot would serve as a relatively succinct summary.</p>
          
          <p>Now suppose those used to receiving just two numbers as summaries ask us for a more compact numerical summary.</p>
          
          <p>The <em>boxplot</em> provides a five-number summary composed of the range (the minimum and maximum) along with the <em>quartiles</em> (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles). The R implementation of boxplots ignore <em>outliers</em> when computing the range and instead plot these as independent points. The help file provides a specific definition of outliers. The boxplot shows these numbers as a "box" with "whiskers"</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders |> ggplot(aes("",rate)) + geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 2)) + xlab("")
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>with the box defined by the 25% and 75% percentile and the whiskers showing the range. The distance between the 25% and 75% percentile is called the <em>interquartile</em> range. The two points are outliers according to the R implementation. The median is shown with a horizontal line.</p>
          
          <p>From just this simple plot, we know that the median is about 2.5, that the distribution is not symmetric, and that the range is 0 to 5 for the great majority of states with two exceptions.</p>
          
          <p>We discuss how to make boxplots later in this chapter.</p>

        <section xml:id="sec-dataviz-stratification">
          <title>Stratification</title>
          
          <p>In data analysis we often divide observations into groups based on the values of one or more variables associated with those observations. For example in the next section we divide the height values into groups based on a sex variable: females and males. We call this procedure <em>stratification</em> and refer to the resulting groups as <em>strata</em>.</p>
          
          <p>Stratification is common in data visualization because we are often interested in how the distributions of variables differ across different subgroups. We will see several examples throughout this part of the book, starting with the next section.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-student-height-cont">
          <title>Case study continued</title>
          
          <p>If we are convinced that the male height data is well approximated with a normal distribution we can report back to ET a very succinct summary: male heights follow a normal distribution with an average of 69.3 inches and a SD of 3.6 inches. With this information, ET will have a good idea of what to expect when he meets our male students. However, to provide a complete picture we need to also provide a summary of the female heights.</p>
          
          <p>Boxplots are useful when we want to quickly compare two or more distributions. Here are the heights for men and women:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
heights |> ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = height, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot()
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>The plot immediately reveals that males are, on average, taller than females. The  interquartile ranges appear to be similar. But does the normal approximation also work for the female height data collected by the survey? We expect that they will follow a normal distribution, just like males. However, exploratory plots reveal that the approximation is not as useful:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
heights |> filter(sex == "Female") |>
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
  geom_density(fill = "#F8766D")
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>We see something we did not see for the males: the density plot has a second "bump". Also, the highest points tend to be taller than expected by the normal than expected heights for a normal distribution. When reporting back to ET, we might need to provide a histogram rather than just the average and standard deviation for the female heights.</p>
          
          <p>However, go back and read Tukey's quote. We have noticed what we didn't expect to see. If we look at other female height distributions, we do find that they are well approximated with a normal distribution. So why are our female students different? Is our class a requirement for the female basketball team? Are small proportions of females claiming to be taller than they are? Another, perhaps more likely, explanation is that in the form students used to enter their heights, <c>FEMALE</c> was the default sex and some males entered their heights, but forgot to change the sex variable. In any case, data visualization has helped discover a potential flaw in our data.</p>
          
          <p>Regarding the five smallest values, note that these values are:</p>
          
          <program language="r">

        <title>ggplot2</title>
        
        <introduction>
          <p>Exploratory data visualization is perhaps the greatest strength of R. One can quickly go from idea to data to plot with a unique balance of flexibility and ease. For example, Excel may be easier than R for some plots, but it is nowhere near as flexible. D3.js may be more flexible and powerful than R, but it takes much longer to generate a plot.</p>
          
          <p>Throughout the book, we will be creating plots using the <alert>ggplot2</alert> package.</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Many other approaches are available for creating plots in R. In fact, the plotting capabilities that come with a basic installation of R are already quite powerful. There are also other packages for creating graphics such as <alert>grid</alert> and <alert>lattice</alert>. We chose to use <alert>ggplot2</alert> in this book because it breaks plots into components in a way that permits beginners to create relatively complex and aesthetically pleasing plots using syntax that is intuitive and comparatively easy to remember.</p>
          
          <p>One reason <alert>ggplot2</alert> is generally more intuitive for beginners is that it uses a grammar of graphics, the <em>gg</em> in <alert>ggplot2</alert>. This is analogous to the way learning grammar can help a beginner construct hundreds of different sentences by learning just a handful of verbs, nouns, and adjectives without having to memorize each specific sentence. Similarly, by learning a handful of <alert>ggplot2</alert> building blocks and its grammar, you will be able to create hundreds of different plots.</p>
          
          <p>Another reason <alert>ggplot2</alert> is easy for beginners is that its default behavior is carefully chosen to satisfy the great majority of cases and is visually pleasing. As a result, it is possible to create informative and elegant graphs with relatively simple and readable code.</p>
          
          <p>One limitation is that <alert>ggplot2</alert> is designed to work exclusively with data tables in tidy format. However, a substantial percentage of datasets that beginners work with are in, or can be converted into, this format. An advantage of this approach is that, assuming that our data is tidy, <alert>ggplot2</alert> simplifies plotting code and the learning of grammar for a variety of plots.</p>
          
          <p>To use <alert>ggplot2</alert> you will have to learn several functions and arguments. These are hard to memorize, so we highly recommend you have the ggplot2 cheat sheet handy. You can get a copy from Posit's website or simply perform an internet search for "ggplot2 cheat sheet".</p>

          <title>The components of a graph</title>
          
          <p>We will construct a graph that summarizes the US murders dataset that looks like this:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(dslabs)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)

r &lt;- murders |> 
  summarize(pop = sum(population), tot = sum(total)) |> 
  mutate(rate = tot/pop*10^6) |> pull(rate)

murders |> ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb)) +  
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty = 2, col = "darkgrey") +

  scale_color_discrete(name = "Region") +
  theme_economist()
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>We can clearly see how much states vary across population size and the total number of murders. Not surprisingly, we also see a clear relationship between murder totals and population size. A state falling on the dashed grey line has the same murder rate as the US average. The four geographic regions are denoted with color, which depicts how most southern states have murder rates above the average.</p>
          
          <p>This data visualization shows us pretty much all the information in the data frame The code needed to make this plot is relatively simple. We will learn to create the plot part by part.</p>
          
          <p>The first step in learning <alert>ggplot2</alert> is to be able to break a graph apart into components. Let's break down the plot above and introduce some of the <alert>ggplot2</alert> terminology. The main three components to note are:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><p><alert>Data</alert>: The US murders data frame is being summarized. We refer to this as the <alert>data</alert> component.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><alert>Geometry</alert>: The plot above is a scatterplot. This is referred to as the <alert>geometry</alert> component. Other possible geometries include barplot, histogram, smooth densities, qqplot, and boxplot. We will learn more about these later in this chapter.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><alert>Aesthetic mapping</alert>: The plot uses several visual cues to represent the information provided by the dataset. The two most important cues in this plot are the point positions on the x-axis and y-axis, which represent population size and the total number of murders, respectively. Each point represents a different observation, and we <em>map</em> data about these observations to visual cues like x- and y-scale. Color is another visual cue that we map to region. We refer to this as the <alert>aesthetic mapping</alert> component. How we define the mapping depends on what <alert>geometry</alert> we are using.</p></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>We also note that:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><p>The points are labeled with the state abbreviations.</p></li>
            <li><p>The range of the x-axis and y-axis appears to be defined by the range of the data. They are both on log-scales.</p></li>
            <li><p>There are labels, a title, a legend, and we use the style of The Economist magazine.</p></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The general approach in <alert>ggplot2</alert> is to construct the plot part by part by adding <em>layers</em> to a <c>ggplot</c> object, created by the <c>ggplot</c> function. Layers can define geometries, compute summary statistics, define what scales to use, or change styles. To add layers, we use the symbol <c>+</c>. In general, a line of code will look like this:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>DATA |&gt; <c>ggplot()</c> + LAYER 1 + LAYER 2 + ... + LAYER N</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>We will now illustrate the basics of ggplot2 by dissecting how we construct the plot above.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-initializing-object">
          <title>Initializing an object with data</title>
          
          <p>We start by loading the relevant dataset which is in the <alert>dslabs package</alert>:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(dslabs)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>The first step in creating a <alert>ggplot2</alert> graph is to define a <c>ggplot</c> object. Typically most or all the layers will be mapping variables from the same dataset, so we associate this object with the relevant data frame</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
ggplot(data = murders)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>or equivalently</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders |> ggplot()
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Both these lines of code render a plot, in this case a blank slate since no geometry has been defined. The only style choice we see is a grey background, the default. We see a plot because an object was created and not assigned to a variable, it was automatically evaluated and printed. But we can assign our plot to an object in the usual way:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
p &lt;- ggplot(data = murders)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>To render the plot associated with this object, we simply print the object <c>p</c>. The following two lines of code each produce the same plot we see above:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
print(p)
p
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>To summarize, <c>p</c> is a <c>ggplot</c> object with the <c>murders</c> data frame as its data component.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-adding-geometry">
          <title>Adding a geometry</title>
          
          <p>A common first step is to let <alert>ggplot2</alert> know what geometry to use. We often add multiple geometries, but we at least need one. In our example, we want to make a scatterplot. Geometries are added using functions. Taking a quick look at the cheat sheet, we see that we should use the function <c>geom_point</c>.</p>
          
          <p>Note that geometry function names follow the pattern: <c>geom_X</c> where X is the name of the geometry. Some examples include <c>geom_histogram</c>, <c>geom_boxplot</c>, and <c>geom_col</c>. We will discuss these further later in this chapter.</p>
          
          <p>For <c>geom_point</c> to run properly we need to provide data and a mapping. We have already assigned the <c>murders</c> data table to the object <c>p</c>. Next we need to add the layer <c>geom_point</c> to define the geometry. To find out what mappings are expected by this function, we read the <alert>Aesthetics</alert> section of the <c>geom_point</c> help file:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p><alert>Aesthetics</alert><br/>
            geom_point() understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><p><alert>x</alert></p></li>
              <li><p><alert>y</alert></p></li>
              <li><p>alpha</p></li>
              <li><p>colour</p></li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>We see that at least two arguments are required: <c>x</c> and <c>y</c>. Next we explain how to map values from the dataset to the plot.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-aesthetic-mappings">
          <title>Aesthetic mappings</title>
          
          <p><em>Aesthetic mappings</em> describe how properties of the data connect with features of the graph, such as distance along an axis, size, or color. The <c>aes</c> function connects data with what we see on the graph by defining aesthetic mappings and will be one of the functions you use most often when plotting. This example produces a scatterplot of total murders versus population in millions:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders |> ggplot() + geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total))
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>We didn't use the <c>x</c> and <c>y</c> to define the arguments because the help file showed these are the first and second expected arguments.</p>
          
          <p>The scale and labels are defined by default when adding this layer. Like <alert>dplyr</alert> functions, <c>aes</c> also uses the variable names from the data component: we can use <c>population</c> and <c>total</c> without having to call them as <c>murders$population</c> and <c>murders$total</c>. The behavior of recognizing the variables from the data component is specific to <c>aes</c>. With <alert>ggplot2</alert> functions other than <c>aes</c>, if you try to access the values of <c>population</c> or <c>total</c>, you receive an error.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-other-layers">
          <title>Other layers</title>
          
          <p>To shape the plot into its final form, we continue to add layers. A second layer in the plot we wish to make involves adding a label to each point to identify the state. The <c>geom_label</c> and <c>geom_text</c> functions permit us to add text to the plot with and without a rectangle behind the text, respectively.</p>
          
          <p>Because each point (each state in this case) has a label, we need an aesthetic mapping to make the connection between points and labels. By reading the help file, we learn that we supply the mapping between point and label through the <c>label</c> argument of <c>aes</c>. So the code looks like this:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders |> ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total)) +
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>As an example of the unique behavior of <c>aes</c> related to variable names, note that if the added layer was <c>geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total), label = abb)</c>, we would result in an error since <c>abb</c> is now outside the call to <c>aes</c> and it is not an object in our workspace, it is a variable name in the data component of the <c>ggplot</c> object.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-global-aesthetic-mappings">
          <title>Global aesthetic mappings</title>
          
          <p>In the previous lines of code, we define the mapping <c>aes(population/10^6, total)</c> twice, once in each layer. We can avoid this by using a <em>global</em> aesthetic mapping. We can do this when we define the blank slate <c>ggplot</c> object. Remember that the <c>mapping</c> argument of <c>ggplot</c> function permits us to define aesthetic mappings. If we define a mapping in <c>ggplot</c>, all the geometries that are added as layers will default to this mapping. So we can simply write the following code to produce the previous plot:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders |> ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = abb))
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Note that the mapping for <c>label</c> is only defined in <c>geom_text</c> because <c>geom_point</c> does not use this argument.</p>
          
          <p>If necessary, we can override the global mapping by defining a new mapping within each layer. These <em>local</em> definitions override the <em>global</em>. Here is an example:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders |> ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(x = 10, y = 800, label = "Hello there!"))
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Clearly, the second call to <c>geom_text</c> does not use <c>population</c> and <c>total</c>.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-non-aesthetic-arguments">
          <title>Non-aesthetic arguments</title>
          
          <p>Each geometry function has arguments other than <c>aes</c> and <c>data</c>. They tend to be specific to the function and are not mapped to variables in the data. For example, in the plot we wish to make, the points are larger than the default size. As another example, to avoid putting the text on top of the point, we can use the <c>nudge_x</c> argument in <c>geom_text</c>. The code, with the arguments, looks like this:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders |> ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = abb), nudge_x = 1.5)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Later in this chapter we learn a better way of assuring we can see the points and the labels.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-categories-as-colors">
          <title>Categories as colors</title>
          
          <p>For the final plot, we want each region to have a different color. Because this information comes from the data, it is a aesthetic mapping. For our example, we can map color to categories using the <c>color</c> mapping in the <c>geom_point</c> function as follows:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
murders |> ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = region), size = 3)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Note the <c>geom_point</c> automatically assigns a different color to each category and also adds a legend! Legends are usually desired, but to avoid adding a legend we can set the <c>geom_point</c> argument <c>show.legend = FALSE</c>.</p>
          
          <p>Note that <c>color</c> is also a non-aesthetic argument in several <alert>ggplot2</alert> functions, including <c>geom_point</c>. This argument is not used to map colors to categories, but to change the color of all the points. For example, if we wanted all the points to be blue we would change the layer to <c>geom_point(col = "blue", size = 3)</c>.</p>
          
          <program language="r">

          <title>Updating ggplot objects</title>
          
          <p>In <alert>ggplot2</alert> we build plots by parts. A useful feature of the package is that we can update existing <c>ggplot</c> objects by adding layers. For example, we can start by initializing an object with a dataset and a global aesthetic</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
p0 &lt;- murders |> ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total))
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>and then start adding layers. For example, we start by adding the scatter plot</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
p1 &lt;- p0 +  geom_point(aes(color = region), size = 3)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>and labels:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
p2 &lt;- p1 + geom_text(aes(label = abb), nudge_x = 0.1)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>In the next few sections, we will be building on objects created in previous sections using this approach. This facilitates improving plots as well as testing options. Note that we changed the <c>nudge_x</c> from 1.5 to 0.1 because in the next section we will apply a log transformation and a smaller value is more appropriate.</p>

        <section xml:id="sec-scales">
          <title>Scales</title>
          
          <p>One of the strengths of <alert>ggplot2</alert> is that the default behavior often is good enough to achieve our visualization goals. However, it also offers ways in which we can change these defaults. Many of these are changed through the <c>scales</c> functions.</p>
          
          <p>Two examples, are the <c>scale_x_continuous</c> and <c>scale_y_continuous</c> functions which lets us make adjustments to the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. In the final plot we are trying to produce scales in log-scale and this can be achieved by assigning the argument <c>trans = "log10"</c> in these functions. However, because this operation is so common, <alert>ggplot2</alert> includes <c>scale_x_log10</c> and <c>scale_y_log10</c> functions. We can achieve the desired transformation by adding these layers:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
p3 &lt;- p2 + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() 
p3
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Be aware that <alert>ggplot2</alert> offers immense flexibility, particularly through the scales functions. We've introduced just one of the many available. In subsequent chapters of this book, we'll provide examples as they become pertinent to our visualizations. However, to familiarize yourself with these functions, we recommend consulting the ggplot2 cheat sheet or conducting internet searches as specific needs arise.</p>

        <section xml:id="sec-annotations">
          <title>Annotations</title>
          
          <p>We often want to add annotations to figures that are not derived directly from the aesthetic mapping. Examples of annotation functions are <c>labs</c>, <c>annotate</c>, and <c>geom_abline</c>. The <c>labs</c> function permits adding a title, subtitle, caption, and other labels. Note these can also be defined individually using the functions such as <c>xlab</c>, <c>ylab</c> and <c>ggtitle</c>.</p>
          
          <p>The <c>labs</c> function also allows another change needed for our desired plot: changing the legend title. Because the legend for the color mapping, this is achieved with the <c>color = "NEW_TITLE"</c> argument:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
p4 &lt;- p3 + labs(title = "US Gun Murders in 2010",
                x = "Populations in millions (log scale)", 
                y = "Total number of murders (log scale)",
                color = "Region")
p4
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Our desired final plot includes a line that represents the average murder rate for the entire country. Once we determine the per million rate to be <m>r</m>, the desired line is defined by the formula: <m>y = r x</m>, with <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> our axes: total murders and population in millions, respectively. In the log-scale this line turns into: <m>\log(y) = \log(r) + \log(x)</m>, a line with slope 1 and intercept <m>\log(r)</m>. We can compute <c>r</c> using:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
r &lt;- murders |> 
  summarize(rate = sum(total)/sum(population)*10^6) |> 
  pull(rate)
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>To add a line we use the <c>geom_abline</c> function. The <c>ab</c> in the name reminds us we are supplying the intercept (<c>a</c>) and slope (<c>b</c>). The default line has slope 1 and intercept 0 so we only have to define the intercept. Note that the final plot has a dashed line type and is grey and these can be changed through the <c>lty</c> (line type) and <c>color</c> non aesthetic arguments. We add the layer like this:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
p5 &lt;- p4 + 
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty = 2, color = "darkgrey") 
p5
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Note that <c>geom_abline</c> does not use any mappings from the data object, once we have the slope.</p>
          
          <p>We are almost there! All we have to do is add optional changes to the style.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section xml:id="sec-add-on-packages">
          <title>Add-on packages</title>
          
          <p>The power of <alert>ggplot2</alert> is augmented further due to the availability of add-on packages. The remaining changes needed to put the finishing touches on our plot require the <alert>ggthemes</alert> and <alert>ggrepel</alert> packages.</p>
          
          <p>The style of a <alert>ggplot2</alert> graph can be changed using the <c>theme</c> functions. Several themes are included as part of the <alert>ggplot2</alert> package. In fact, for most of the plots in this book, we use a function in the <alert>dslabs</alert> package that automatically sets a default theme:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
ds_theme_set()
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>Many other themes are added by the package <alert>ggthemes</alert>. Among those is the <c>theme_economist</c> theme that we use here. After installing the package, you can change the style by adding a layer like this:</p>
          
          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(ggthemes)
p6 &lt;- p5 + theme_economist()
            </input>
          </program>
          
          <p>You can see how some of the other themes look by simply changing the function. For instance, you might try the <c>theme_fivethirtyeight()</c> theme instead.</p>
          
          <p>The final change is to better position of the labels to avoid crowding; currently, some of the labels fall on top of each other. The add-on package <alert>ggrepel</alert> includes a geometry that adds labels while ensuring that they don't fall on top of each other. We simply change <c>geom_text</c> to <c>geom_text_repel</c>.</p>

          <p>In our illustrative example we introduced the scatterplot geometry <c>geom_point</c>. However, <alert>ggplot2</alert> has many others and here we demonstrate how to generate plots related to distributions, specifically the plots shown in <xref ref="ch-visualizing-data-distributions"/>.</p>

            <title>Barplots</title>
            
            <p>To generate a barplot we can use the <c>geom_bar</c> geometry. The default is to count the number of each category and draw a bar. Here is the plot for the regions of the US.</p>

            <p>However, we often already have a table with the numbers we want to present as a barplot. Here is an example of such a table:</p>

            <p>To generate histograms we use <c>geom_histogram</c>. By looking at the help file for this function, we learn that the only required argument is <c>x</c>, the variable for which we will construct a histogram.

            </program>
            
            <p>Note that we use the optional arguments <c>binwidth = 1</c> to change the bin size to 1 inch. The default is to create 30 bins. We also use the optional arguments <c>fill = "blue"</c> and <c>col = "black"</c> to fill the bars with colors and use a different color to outline the bars.</p>

            <title>Density plots</title>
            
            <p>To create a smooth density, we use the <c>geom_density</c>. To make a smooth density plot with the data previously shown as a histogram we can use this code:</p>
            
            <program language="r">

              <p>Why is this?</p>
              
              <p>a.  We need to map a character to each point through the label argument in aes.<br/>
              b.  We need to let <c>geom_label</c> know what character to use in the plot.<br/>
              c.  The <c>geom_label</c> geometry does not require x-axis and y-axis values.<br/>
              d.  <c>geom_label</c> is not a ggplot2 command.</p>

              <p>Change the color of the labels to blue. How will we do this?</p>
              
              <p>a.  Adding a column called <c>blue</c> to <c>murders</c>.<br/>
              b.  Because each label needs a different color, we map the colors through <c>aes</c>.<br/>
              c.  Use the <c>color</c> argument in <c>ggplot</c>.<br/>
              d.  Because we want all labels to be blue, we do not need to map colors, just use the color argument in <c>geom_label</c>.</p>

            <li><p>Rewrite the code above to make the labels blue.</p></li>
            
            <li>
              <p>Now suppose we want to use color to represent the different regions. In this case which of the following is most appropriate:</p>
              
              <p>a.  Adding a column called <c>color</c> to <c>murders</c> with the color we want to use.<br/>
              b.  Because each label needs a different color, we map the colors through the color argument of <c>aes</c> .<br/>
              c.  Use the <c>color</c> argument in <c>ggplot</c>.<br/>
              d.  Because we want all colors to be blue, we do not need to map colors, just use the color argument in <c>geom_label</c>.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><p>Rewrite the code above to make the labels' colors be determined by the state's region.</p></li>
            
            <li>
              <p>Now we are going to change the x-axis to a log scale to account for the fact the distribution of population is skewed. Let's start by defining an object <c>p</c> holding the plot we have made up to now</p>
              
              <program language="r">

              </program>
              
              <p>To change the y-axis to a log scale we learned about the <c>scale_x_log10()</c> function. Add this layer to the object <c>p</c> to change the scale and render the plot.</p>

            <li><p>Repeat the previous exercise but now change both axes to be in the log scale.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Now edit the code above to add the title "Gun murder data" to the plot. Hint: use the <c>ggtitle</c> function.</p></li>
            
            <li>
              <p>Now we are going to use the <c>geom_histogram</c> function to make a histogram of the heights in the <c>height</c> data frame. When reading the documentation for this function we see that it requires just one mapping, the values to be used for the histogram. Make a histogram of all the plots.</p>

              d.  <c>heights$height</c></p>
            </li>
            
            <li><p>Now create a ggplot object using the pipe to assign the heights data to a ggplot object. Assign <c>height</c> to the x values through the <c>aes</c> function.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Now we are ready to add a layer to actually make the histogram. Use the object created in the previous exercise and the <c>geom_histogram</c> function to make the histogram.</p></li>
            
            <li>
              <p>Note that when we run the code in the previous exercise we get the warning: <c>stat_bin()</c> using <c>bins = 30</c>. Pick better value with <c>binwidth</c>.</p>
              
              <p>Use the <c>binwidth</c> argument to change the histogram made in the previous exercise to use bins of size 1 inch.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><p>Instead of a histogram, we are going to make a smooth density plot. In this case we will not make an object, but instead render the plot with one line of code. Change the geometry in the code previously used to make a smooth density instead of a histogram.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Now we are going to make a density plot for males and females separately. We can do this using the <c>group</c> argument. We assign groups via the aesthetic mapping as each point needs to a group before making the calculations needed to estimate a density.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>We can also assign groups through the <c>color</c> argument. This has the added benefit that it uses colors to distinguish the groups. Change the code above to use color.</p></li>
            
            <li>
              <p>We can also assign groups through the <c>fill</c> argument. This has the added benefit that it uses colors to distinguish the groups, like this:</p>

              <p>However, here the second density is drawn over the other. We can make the curves more visible by using alpha blending to add transparency. Set the alpha parameter to 0.2 in the <c>geom_density</c> function to make this change.</p>

      <chapter xml:id="ch-data-visualization-principles">
        <title>Data visualization principles</title>
        
          <p>In this chapter we aim to provide some general principles we can use as a guide for effective data visualization. Much of this section is based on a talk by Karl Broman titled "Creating Effective Figures and Tables" and includes some of the figures which were made with code that Karl makes available on his GitHub repository, as well as class notes from Peter Aldhous' Introduction to Data Visualization course. Following Karl's approach, we show some examples of plot styles we should avoid, explain how to improve them, and use these as motivation for a list of principles. We compare and contrast plots that follow these principles to those that don't.</p>

          <p>The principles are mostly based on research related to how humans detect patterns and make visual comparisons. The preferred approaches are those that best fit the way our brains process visual information. When deciding on a visualization approach, it is also important to keep our goal in mind. We may be comparing a viewable number of quantities, describing distributions for categories or numeric values, comparing the data from two groups, or describing the relationship between two variables. As a final note, we want to emphasize that it is important to adapt and optimize graphs to the audience. For example, an exploratory plot made for ourselves will be different than a chart intended to communicate a finding to a general audience.</p>

          <p>In this chapter we focus on the principles and do not show code (code can be viewed on GitHub). In <xref ref="sec-dataviz-in-practice"/>, we apply these principles in case study and do show code.</p>

        <section xml:id="sec-encoding-data-using-visual-cues">
          <title>Encoding data using visual cues</title>

          <p>We start by describing some principles for encoding data. There are several visual cues at our disposal including position, aligned lengths, angles, area, brightness, and color hue.</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
browsers &lt;- data.frame(Browser = rep(c("Opera","Safari","Firefox","IE","Chrome"),2),
                       Year = rep(c(2000, 2015), each = 5),
                       Percentage = c(3,21,23,28,26, 2,22,21,27,29)) |&gt;
  mutate(Browser = reorder(Browser, Percentage))
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>To illustrate how some of these visual cues compare, let's suppose we want to report the results from two hypothetical polls regarding browser preference taken in 2000 and then 2015. For each year, we are simply comparing five quantities – the five percentages. A widely used graphical representation of percentages, popularized by Microsoft Excel, is the pie chart:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(ggthemes)
p1 &lt;- browsers |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = "", y = Percentage, fill = Browser)) +
  geom_col(width = 1, col = "black")  + coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  xlab("") + ylab("") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid  = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(.~Year)
p1
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Here we are representing quantities with both areas and angles, since both the angle and area of each pie slice are proportional to the quantity the slice represents. This turns out to be a sub-optimal choice since, as demonstrated by perception studies, humans are not good at precisely quantifying angles and are even worse when area is the only available visual cue. The donut chart is an example of a plot that uses only area:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
browsers |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = 2, y = Percentage, fill = Browser)) +
  geom_col(width = 1, col = "black")  + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0.5,2.5)) + coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  xlab("") + ylab("") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid  = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(.~Year)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>To see how hard it is to quantify angles and area, note that the rankings and all the percentages in the plots above changed from 2000 to 2015. Can you determine the actual percentages and rank the browsers' popularity? Can you see how the percentages changed from 2000 to 2015? It is not easy to tell from the plot.</p>

          <p>In this case, simply showing the numbers is not only clearer, but would also save on printing costs if printing a paper copy:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  browsers |&gt; spread(Year, Percentage) |&gt; knitr::kable("html") |&gt;
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
   browsers |&gt; spread(Year, Percentage) |&gt; 
    knitr::kable("latex", booktabs = TRUE) |&gt;
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>The preferred way to plot these quantities is to use length and position as visual cues, since humans are much better at judging linear measures. The barplot uses this approach by using bars of length proportional to the quantities of interest. By adding horizontal lines at strategically chosen values, in this case at every multiple of 10, we ease the visual burden of quantifying through the position of the top of the bars. Compare and contrast the information we can extract from the two figures.</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
p2 &lt;-browsers |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(Browser, Percentage)) + 
  geom_col(width=0.5) +
  ylab("Percent using the Browser") +
  facet_grid(.~Year)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Notice how much easier it is to see the differences in the barplot. In fact, we can now determine the actual percentages by following a horizontal line to the x-axis.</p>

          <p>If for some reason you need to make a pie chart, label each pie slice with its respective percentage so viewers do not have to infer them from the angles or area:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(scales)
browsers &lt;- filter(browsers, Year == 2015)
at &lt;- with(browsers, 100 - cumsum(c(0,Percentage[-length(Percentage)])) - 0.5*Percentage)  
label &lt;- percent(browsers$Percentage/100)
browsers |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = "", y = Percentage, fill = Browser)) +
  geom_col(width = 1, col = "black")  + coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  xlab("") + ylab("") + ggtitle("2015") +
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid  = element_blank()) +
  annotate(geom = "text", 
              x = 1.62, 
              y =  at, 
              label = label, size=4)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>In general, when displaying quantities, position and length are preferred over angles and/or area. Brightness and color are even harder to quantify than angles. But, as we will see later, they are sometimes useful when more than two dimensions must be displayed at once.</p>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-know-when-to-include-0">
          <title>Know when to include 0</title>

          <p>When using length as a visual cue, it is misinformative not to start the bars at 0. This is because, by using length as a visual cue, say with a barplot, we are implying the length is proportional to the quantities being displayed. By avoiding 0, relatively small differences can be made to look much bigger than they actually are. This approach is often used by politicians or media organizations trying to exaggerate a difference. Below is an illustrative example:</p>

          <figure>
            <image source="dataviz/img/class2_8.jpg"/>
          </figure>

          <p>(Source: Fox News, via Media Matters.)</p>

          <p>From the plot above, it appears that apprehensions have almost tripled when, in fact, they have only increased by about 16%. Starting the graph at 0 illustrates this clearly:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
data.frame(Year = as.character(c(2011, 2012, 2013)),Southwest_Border_Apprehensions = c(165244,170223,192298)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(Year, Southwest_Border_Apprehensions )) +
  geom_col(fill = "yellow", col = "black", width = 0.65) 
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Here is another example:</p>

          <p><!--http://i2.wp.com/flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Bush-cuts.png--></p>

          <figure>
            <image source="dataviz/img/Bush-cuts.png"/>
          </figure>

          <p>(Source: Fox News, via Flowing Data.)</p>

          <p>This plot makes a 13% increase look like a five fold change. Here is the appropriate plot:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
data.frame(date = c("Now", "Jan 1, 2013"), tax_rate = c(35, 39.6)) |&gt;
  mutate(date = reorder(date, tax_rate)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(date, tax_rate)) + 
  ylab("") + xlab("") +
  geom_col(fill = "yellow", col = "black", width = 0.5) + 
  ggtitle("Top Tax Rate If Bush Tax Cut Expires")
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Finally, here is an extreme example that makes a very small difference of under 2% look like a 10-100 fold change:</p>

          <p><!-- http://i2.wp.com/flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Bush-cuts.png--></p>

          <figure>
            <image source="dataviz/img/venezuela-election.png"/>
          </figure>

          <p>(Source: Venezolana de Televisión via El Mundo.)</p>

          <p>Here is the appropriate plot:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
data.frame(Candidate = factor(c("Maduro", "Capriles"), levels = c("Maduro", "Capriles")),
           Percent = c(50.66, 49.07)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(Candidate, Percent, fill = Candidate)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.65, show.legend = FALSE) 
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>When using position rather than length, it is then not necessary to include 0. This is particularly the case when we want to compare differences between groups relative to the within-group variability. Here is an illustrative example showing country average life expectancy stratified across continents in 2012:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
p1 &lt;- gapminder |&gt; filter(year == 2012) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(continent, life_expectancy)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1)
p2 &lt;- p1 +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 84))
grid.arrange(p2, p1, ncol = 2)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Note that in the plot on the left, which includes 0, the space between 0 and 43 adds no information and makes it harder to compare the between and within group variability.</p>

          <title>Do not distort quantities</title>

          <p>During President Barack Obama’s 2011 State of the Union Address, the following chart was used to compare the US GDP to the GDP of four competing nations:</p>

          <p><!--idea from http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/img/class2_30.jpg--> <!--screen shot my own from state of the union--></p>

          </figure>

          <p>(Source: The 2011 State of the Union Address)</p>

          <p>Judging by the area of the circles, the US appears to have an economy over five times larger than China's and over 30 times larger than France's. However, if we look at the actual numbers, we see that this is not the case. The actual ratios are 2.6 and 5.8 times bigger than China and France, respectively. The reason for this distortion is that the radius, rather than the area, was made to be proportional to the quantity, which implies that the proportion between the areas is squared: 2.6 turns into 6.5 and 5.8 turns into 34.1. Here is a comparison of the circles we get if we make the value proportional to the radius and to the area:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
gdp &lt;- c(14.6, 5.7, 5.3, 3.3, 2.5)
gdp_data &lt;- data.frame(Country = rep(c("United States", "China", "Japan", "Germany", "France"),2),
           y = factor(rep(c("Radius","Area"),each=5), levels = c("Radius", "Area")),
           GDP= c(gdp^2/min(gdp^2), gdp/min(gdp))) |&gt; 
   mutate(Country = reorder(Country, GDP))
gdp_data |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(Country, y, size = GDP)) + 
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE, color = "blue") + 
  scale_size(range = c(2,20)) +
  coord_flip() + ylab("") + xlab("")
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Not surprisingly, __ggplot2__ defaults to using area rather than radius. Of course, in this case, we really should not be using area at all since we can use position and length:</p>

          <title>Order categories by a meaningful value</title>

          <p>When one of the axes is used to show categories, as is done in barplots and boxplots, the default __ggplot2__ behavior is to order the categories alphabetically when they are defined by character strings. If they are defined by factors, they are ordered by the factor levels. We rarely want to use alphabetical order. Instead, we should order by a meaningful quantity. In all the cases above, the barplots were ordered by the values being displayed. The exception was the graph showing barplots comparing browsers. In this case, we kept the order the same across the barplots to ease the comparison. Specifically, instead of ordering the browsers separately in the two years, we ordered both years by the average value of 2000 and 2015.</p>

          <p>To appreciate how the right order can help convey a message, suppose we want to create a plot to compare the murder rate across states. We are particularly interested in the most dangerous and safest states. Note the difference when we order alphabetically (the default) versus when we order by the actual rate:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>

        <section xml:id="sec-show-the-data">
          <title>Show the data</title>

          <p>We have focused on displaying single quantities across categories. We now shift our attention to displaying data, with a focus on comparing groups.</p>

          <p>To motivate the principle, "show the data", we go back to our artificial example of describing heights to ET, an extraterrestrial. This time let's assume ET is interested in the difference in heights between males and females. A commonly seen plot used for comparisons between groups, popularized by software such as Microsoft Excel, is the dynamite plot, which shows the average and standard errors (standard errors are defined in a later chapter, but do not confuse them with the standard deviation of the data). The plot looks like this:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
p1 &lt;- heights |&gt; 
  group_by(sex) |&gt; 
  summarize(average = mean(height), se=sd(height)/sqrt(n())) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(sex, average)) + 
  theme_excel() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = average - 2*se, ymax = average+2*se), width = 0.25) +
  geom_col(width=0.5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  ylab("Height in inches")
p1
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>The average of each group is represented by the top of each bar and the antennae extend out from the average to the average plus two standard errors.  If all ET receives is this plot, he will have little information on what to expect if he meets a group of human males and females. The bars go to 0: does this mean there are tiny humans measuring less than one foot? Are all males taller than the tallest females? Is there a range of heights? ET can't answer these questions since we have provided almost no information on the height distribution.</p>

          <p>This brings us the "show the data" principle. This simple __ggplot2__ code already generates a more informative plot than the barplot by simply showing all the data points:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
#| echo: false
heights |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(sex, height)) + 
  geom_point() 
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>For example, this plot gives us an idea of the range of the data. However, this plot has limitations as well, since we can't really see all the points plotted for females and males, respectively, and many points are plotted on top of each other. As we have previously described, visualizing the distribution is much more informative. But before doing this, we point out two ways we can improve a plot showing all the points.</p>

          <p>The first is to add <em>jitter</em>, which adds a small random shift to each point. In this case, adding horizontal jitter does not alter the interpretation, since the point heights do not change, but we minimize the number of points that fall on top of each other and, therefore, get a better visual sense of how the data is distributed. A second improvement comes from using <em>alpha blending</em>: making the points somewhat transparent. The more points fall on top of each other, the darker the plot, which also helps us get a sense of how the points are distributed. Here is the same plot with jitter and alpha blending:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
heights |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(sex, height)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.05, alpha = 0.2) 
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Now we start getting a sense that, on average, males are taller than females. We also note dark horizontal bands of points, demonstrating that many report values that are rounded to the nearest integer.</p>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-use-common-axes">
            <title>Use common axes</title>

            <p>Since there are so many points, it is more effective to show distributions rather than individual points. We therefore show histograms for each group:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
heights |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = after_stat(density))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  facet_grid(.~sex, scales = "free_x")
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>However, from this plot it is not immediately obvious that males are, on average, taller than females. We have to look carefully to notice that the x-axis has a higher range of values in the male histogram. An important principle here is to <alert>keep the axes the same</alert> when comparing data across two plots. Below we see how the comparison becomes a little easier:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
heights |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(height, y = after_stat(density))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  facet_grid(.~sex)
              </input>
            </program>

          </subsection>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-aligning-plots-for-comparisons">
            <title>Aligning plots for comparisons</title>

            <p>In these histograms, the visual cue related to decreases or increases in height are shifts to the left or right, respectively: horizontal changes. Aligning the plots vertically helps us see this change when the axes are fixed:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
p2 &lt;- heights |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(height, after_stat(density))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  facet_grid(sex~.)
p2
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>This plot makes it much easier to notice that men are, on average, taller.</p>

            <p>If we want the more compact summary provided by boxplots, we then align them horizontally since, by default, boxplots move up and down with changes in height. Following our <em>show the data</em> principle, we then overlay all the data points:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
p3 &lt;- heights |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(sex, height)) + 
  geom_boxplot(coef = 3) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +
  ylab("Height in inches")
p3
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Now contrast and compare these three plots, based on exactly the same data:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Notice how much more we learn from the two plots on the right. Barplots are useful for showing one number, but not very useful when we want to describe distributions.</p>

        <section xml:id="sec-log-transform">
          <title>Log transformations</title>

          <p>The combination of an incorrectly chosen barplot and a failure to use a transformation when one is merited can be particularly distorting. As an example, consider this barplot showing the average population sizes for each continent in 2015:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
p1 &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == 2015) |&gt;
  group_by(continent) |&gt; 
  summarize(population = mean(population)) |&gt;
  mutate(continent = reorder(continent, population)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(continent, population/10^6)) + 
  geom_col(width=0.5, fill = "blue") +
  theme_excel() + 
  ylab("Population in Millions") +
  xlab("Continent")
p1
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>From this plot, one would conclude that countries in Asia are much more populous than in other continents. Following the <em>show the data</em> principle, we quickly notice that this is due to two very large countries, which we assume are India and China:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
p2 &lt;- gapminder |&gt; filter(year == 2015) |&gt; 
  mutate(continent = reorder(continent, population, median)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(continent, population/10^6)) + 
  ylab("Population in Millions") +
  xlab("Continent")
p2 +  geom_jitter(width = .1, alpha = .5) 
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Here, we focus on examples in which the log transformation improves data visualization of skewed data. Other common transformations to be aware of include the logistic transformation (<c>logit</c>), which is useful for interpreting fold changes in odds, and the square root transformation (<c>sqrt</c>), which is often applied to stabilize variance in count data.</p>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-right-skewed-distributions">
            <title>Right-skewed distributions</title>

            <p>Country population sizes provide a clear example of a <em>right-skewed</em> distribution: most countries have relatively small populations, while a few have extremely large ones. As shown in the box plot above, this imbalance causes most of the data points to be compressed into a small area of the plot, while a large portion of the plotting space is left empty. This makes it difficult to see meaningful differences among the majority of countries.</p>

            <p>In <xref ref="sec-scales"/>, we saw how applying a log transformation improved the readability of a scatter plot by addressing this kind of skew. Similarly, applying a log transformation to population sizes here produces a much more informative visualization. Below, we compare the original barplot to a boxplot with a log-transformed y-axis to illustrate the improvement.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
p2 &lt;- p2 + geom_boxplot(coef = 3) + 
  geom_jitter(width = .1, alpha = .5) + 
  scale_y_log10(breaks = c(1,10,100,1000)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7)) 
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>With the new plot, we realize that countries in Africa actually have a larger median population size than those in Asia.</p>

          </subsection>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-ratios">
            <title>Ratios</title>

            <p>Ratios are commonly used in data analysis to compare two values. For example, we often report the relative risk of developing a disease, such as stating that the risk of disease is <em>three times higher</em> in smokers than in non-smokers.</p>

            <p>Conceptually, ratios are centered around 1, where a ratio of 1 indicates no difference between the two values. However, mathematically, ratios are not symmetric around 1. For instance, if the ratio of <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is <m>3</m>, meaning <m>A</m> is three times larger than <m>B</m>, the reverse ratio of <m>B</m> to <m>A</m> is <m>1/3</m>. Notice that <m>3</m> and <m>1/3</m> are not equally distant from 1, which can make it difficult to visualize ratios in a way that fairly represents increases and decreases.</p>

            <p>For this reason, it is common to use a log transformation when displaying ratios. This is because the logarithm of a ratio has a symmetric property:</p>

            <me>
\log(A/B) = -\log(B/A)
            </me>

            <p>This means that if <m>A</m> is three times larger than <m>B</m>, the log ratio is equally distant from zero as when <m>B</m> is three times larger than <m>A</m>, but in the opposite direction. This symmetry around zero makes differences easier to interpret visually.</p>

            <p>Below is a plot demonstrating the advantage of using a log scale for displaying ratios.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
#| echo: false
p &lt;- data.frame(Value = c(1 / c(10, 5, 2), c(1, 2, 5, 10))) |&gt;
  mutate(
    id = seq_along(Value),
    label = c(paste0("frac(1,", c(10, 5, 2), ")"),
      as.character(c(1, 2, 5, 10)))) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(id, Value)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label), parse = TRUE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = 2, color = "grey") +
  xlab("Arbitrary index") +

              </input>
            </program>

            <note>
              <p>A common challenge when plotting log ratios is handling zeros in either the numerator or denominator, since <m>\log(0)</m> is undefined. Additionally, very small values can produce log ratios that approach positive or negative infinity, making the results unstable and difficult to interpret.</p>
              <p>A practical solution to address both issues is to apply a <em>continuity correction</em>, which involves adding a small constant to both the numerator and denominator. This prevents zeros and stabilizes extreme values. A commonly used constant is 0.5, leading to the following adjusted log ratio:</p>
              <me>
\log\left( \frac{A + 0.5}{B + 0.5} \right)
              </me>
              <p>This simple adjustment helps ensure that log ratios remain finite and more interpretable, particularly when dealing with values close to 0. Additionally, when <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are large, it closely approximates the actual log ratio <m>\log(A/B)</m>.</p>

In every single instance in which we have examined the relationship between two variables, including total murders versus population size and life expectancy versus fertility rates, we have used scatterplots. This is the plot we generally recommend. However, there are some exceptions and we describe two alternative plots here: the <em>slope chart</em> and the <em>Bland-Altman plot</em>.</p>

              <input>
#| echo: false
west &lt;- c("Western Europe","Northern Europe","Southern Europe",
          "Northern America","Australia and New Zealand")

dat &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year%in% c(2010, 2015) &amp; region %in% west &amp; 
           !is.na(life_expectancy) &amp; population &gt; 10^7) 

dat |&gt;
  mutate(location = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 2), 
         location = ifelse(year == 2015 &amp; 
                             country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Portugal"),
                           location+0.22, location),
         hjust = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 0)) |&gt;
  mutate(year = as.factor(year)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, group = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = country), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(x = location, label = country, hjust = hjust), 
            show.legend = FALSE) +
  xlab("") + ylab("Life Expectancy")
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>An advantage of the slope chart is that it permits us to quickly get an idea of changes based on the slope of the lines. Although we are using angle as the visual cue, we also have position to determine the exact values. Comparing the improvements is a bit harder with a scatterplot:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
#| echo: false
library(ggrepel)

dat &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year%in% c(2010, 2015) &amp; region %in% west &amp; 
           !is.na(life_expectancy) &amp; population &gt; 10^7) 

dat |&gt; 
  mutate(year = paste0("life_expectancy_", year)) |&gt;
  select(country, year, life_expectancy) |&gt;
  spread(year, life_expectancy) |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(x=life_expectancy_2010,y=life_expectancy_2015, label = country)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_text_repel() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(78.5, 83)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(78.5, 83)) +
  geom_abline(lty = 2) +
  xlab("2010") + 
  ylab("2015")
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>In the scatterplot, we have followed the principle <em>use common axes</em> since we are comparing these before and after. However, if we have many points, slope charts stop being useful as it becomes hard to see all the lines.</p>

          <p>An earlier scatterplot showed the relationship between infant survival and average income. Below is a version of this plot that encodes three additional variables: OPEC membership, region, and population.</p>

          <p>We encode categorical variables with color and shape. These shapes can be controlled with <c>shape</c>  argument. Below are the shapes available for use in R. For the last five, the color goes inside.</p>

          <program language="r">

          </program>

          <p>For continuous variables, we can use color, intensity, or size. We now show an example of how we do this with a case study.</p>

          <p>When selecting colors to quantify a numeric variable, we choose between two options: sequential and diverging. Sequential colors are suited for data that goes from high to low.  High values are clearly distinguished from low values. Here are some examples offered by the package <c>RColorBrewer</c>:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(RColorBrewer)
rafalib::mypar()
display.brewer.all(type = "seq")
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Diverging colors are used to represent values that diverge from a center. We put equal emphasis on both ends of the data range: higher than the center and lower than the center. An example of when we would use a divergent pattern would be if we were to show height in standard deviations away from the average. Here are some examples of divergent patterns:</p>

          <title>Avoid pseudo-three-dimensional plots</title>

          <p>The figure below, taken from the scientific literature, shows three variables: dose, drug type and survival. Although your screen/book page is flat and two-dimensional, the plot tries to imitate three dimensions and assigned a dimension to each variable.</p>

          <p><!-- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/master/Figs/fig8b.png--></p>

          <p>Humans are not good at seeing in three dimensions (which explains why it is hard to parallel park) and our limitation is even worse with regard to pseudo-three-dimensions. To see this, try to determine the values of the survival variable in the plot above. Can you tell when the purple ribbon intersects the red one? This is an example in which we can easily use color to represent the categorical variable instead of using a pseudo-3D:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
##First read data
url &lt;- "https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/raw/master/R/fig8dat.csv"
dat &lt;- read.csv(url)

##Now make alternative plot
dat |&gt; gather(drug, survival, -log.dose) |&gt;
  mutate(drug = gsub("Drug.","",drug)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(log.dose, survival, color = drug)) +
  geom_line()    
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Notice how much easier it is to determine the survival values.</p>

          <p>Pseudo-3D is sometimes used completely gratuitously: plots are made to look 3D even when the 3rd dimension does not represent a quantity. This only adds confusion and makes it harder to relay your message.  Here are two examples:</p>

          <title>Avoid too many significant digits</title>

          <p>By default, statistical software like R returns many significant digits. The default behavior in R is to show 7 significant digits. That many digits often adds no information and the added visual clutter can make it hard for the viewer to understand the message. As an example, here are the per 10,000 disease rates, computed from totals and population in R, for California across the five decades:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
tmp &lt;- options()$digits
options(digits=7)
dat &lt;- us_contagious_diseases |&gt;
  filter(year %in% seq(1940, 1980, 10) &amp;  state == "California" &amp;
          disease %in% c("Measles", "Pertussis", "Polio")) |&gt;
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000) |&gt; 
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate)) |&gt; 
  select(state, year, disease, rate) |&gt;
  spread(disease, rate)
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::kable(dat, "html") |&gt;
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(dat, "latex", booktabs = TRUE) |&gt;
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
options(digits = tmp)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>We are reporting precision up to 0.00001 cases per 10,000, a very small value in the context of the changes that are occurring across the dates. In this case, one significant figures is enough and clearly makes the point that rates are decreasing:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
dat &lt;- dat |&gt; 
  mutate_at(c("Measles", "Pertussis", "Polio"), ~round(., digits=1))
if(knitr::is_html_output()){
  knitr::kable(dat, "html") |&gt;
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(dat, "latex", booktabs = TRUE) |&gt;
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size=8)
}
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Useful ways to change the number of significant digits or to round numbers are <c>signif</c> and <c>round</c>. You can define the number of significant digits globally by setting options like this: <c>options(digits = 3)</c>.</p>

          <p>Another principle related to displaying tables is to place values being compared on columns rather than rows. Note that our table above is easier to read than this one:</p>

          <program language="r">

  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000) |&gt; 
  mutate(state = reorder(state, rate)) |&gt; 
  select(state, year, disease, rate) |&gt;

  rename(State = state, Disease = disease) |&gt;

          <p>Graphs can be used 1) for our own exploratory data analysis, 2) to convey a message to experts, or 3) to help convey a message to a general audience. Make sure that the intended audience understands each element of the plot.</p>

          <p>As a simple example, consider that for your own exploration it may be more useful to log-transform data and then plot it. However, for a general audience that is unfamiliar with converting logged values back to the original measurements, using a log-scale for the axis instead of log-transformed values will be much easier to digest.</p>

          <p>a. They provide the same information, so they are both equally as good. b. The plot on the right is better because it orders the states alphabetically. c. The plot on the right is better because alphabetical order has nothing to do with the disease and by ordering according to actual rate, we quickly see the states with most and least rates. d. Both plots should be a pie chart.</p>

          <p>a. Humans are not good at reading pseudo-3D plots. b. There must be an error in the code. c. The colors confuse us. d. Scatterplots should not be used to compare two variables when we have access to 3.</p>

          <p>In this chapter, we will demonstrate how relatively simple <alert>ggplot2</alert> code can create insightful and aesthetically pleasing plots. As motivation we will create plots that help us better understand trends in world health and economics. We will implement what we learned in <xref ref="sec-ggplot2"/> and <xref ref="sec-dataviz-principles"/> and learn how to augment the code to perfect the plots. As we go through our case study, we will describe relevant general data visualization principles and learn concepts such as <em>faceting</em>, <em>time series plots</em>, <em>transformations</em>, and <em>ridge plots</em>.</p>

          <title>Case study 1: new insights on poverty</title>

          <p>Hans Rosling was the co-founder of the Gapminder Foundation, an organization dedicated to educating the public by using data to dispel common myths about the so-called developing world. The organization uses data to show how actual trends in health and economics contradict the narratives that emanate from sensationalist media coverage of catastrophes, tragedies, and other unfortunate events. As stated in the Gapminder Foundation's website:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Journalists and lobbyists tell dramatic stories. That's their job. They tell stories about extraordinary events and unusual people. The piles of dramatic stories pile up in peoples' minds into an over-dramatic worldview and strong negative stress feelings: "The world is getting worse!", "It's we vs. them!", "Other people are strange!", "The population just keeps growing!" and "Nobody cares!"</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Hans Rosling conveyed actual data-based trends in a dramatic way of his own, using effective data visualization. This section is based on two talks that exemplify this approach to education: New Insights on Poverty and The Best Stats You've Ever Seen. Specifically, in this section, we use data to attempt to answer the following two questions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><p>Is it a fair characterization of today's world to say it is divided into western rich nations and the developing world in Africa, Asia, and Latin America?</p></li>
            <li><p>Has income inequality across countries worsened during the last 40 years?</p></li>
          </ol>

          <p>To answer these questions, we will be using the <c>gapminder</c> dataset provided in <alert>dslabs</alert>. This dataset was created using a number of spreadsheets available from the Gapminder Foundation. You can access the table like this:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
gapminder |&gt; as_tibble()
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>As done in the <em>New Insights on Poverty</em> video, we start by testing our knowledge regarding differences in child mortality across different countries. For each of the six pairs of countries below, which country do you think had the highest child mortality rates in 2015? Which pairs do you think are most similar?</p>

          <ol>
            <li><p>Sri Lanka or Turkey</p></li>
            <li><p>Poland or South Korea</p></li>
            <li><p>Malaysia or Russia</p></li>
            <li><p>Pakistan or Vietnam</p></li>
            <li><p>Thailand or South Africa</p></li>
          </ol>

          <p>When answering these questions without data, the non-European countries are typically picked as having higher child mortality rates: Sri Lanka over Turkey, South Korea over Poland, and Malaysia over Russia. It is also common to assume that countries considered to be part of the developing world: Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, and South Africa, have similarly high mortality rates.</p>

          <p>To answer these questions <alert>with data</alert>, we can use <alert>dplyr</alert>. For example, for the first comparison we see that:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == 2015 &amp; country %in% c("Sri Lanka","Turkey")) |&gt; 
  select(country, infant_mortality)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Turkey has the higher infant mortality rate.</p>

          <p>We can use this code on all comparisons and find the following:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
comp_table &lt;- tibble(comparison = rep(1:5, each = 2),
           country = c("Sri Lanka", "Turkey", "Poland", "South Korea", "Malaysia", "Russia", "Pakistan","Vietnam","Thailand","South Africa"))

tmp &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == 2015) |&gt; 
  select(country, infant_mortality) |&gt; 
  mutate(country = as.character(country)) ##to match characters to characters
  
tab &lt;- inner_join(comp_table, tmp, by = "country") |&gt; select(-comparison)
  
tmp &lt;- cbind(slice(tab,seq(1,9,2)), slice(tab,seq(2,10,2)))
if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  knitr::kable(tmp, "html") |&gt;
    kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
} else{
  knitr::kable(tmp, "latex", booktabs = TRUE) |&gt;
    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 8)
}
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>We see that the European countries on this list have higher child mortality rates: Poland has a higher rate than South Korea, and Russia has a higher rate than Malaysia. We also see that Pakistan has a much higher rate than Vietnam, and South Africa has a much higher rate than Thailand. It turns out that when Hans Rosling gave this quiz to educated groups of people, the average score was less than 2.5 out of 5, worse than what they would have obtained had they guessed randomly. This implies that more than ignorant, we are misinformed. In this chapter we see how data visualization helps inform us.</p>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-scatterplots">
          <title>Scatterplots</title>

          <p>The reason for the misconception described in the previous section stems from the preconceived notion that the world is divided into two groups: the western world (Western Europe and North America), characterized by long life spans and small families, versus the developing world (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) characterized by short life spans and large families. But do the data support this dichotomous view?</p>

          <p>The necessary data to answer this question is also available in our <c>gapminder</c> table. Using our newly learned data visualization skills, we will be able to tackle this challenge.</p>

          <p>In order to analyze this world view, our first plot is a scatterplot of life expectancy versus fertility rates (average number of children per woman). We start by looking at data from about 50 years ago, when perhaps this view was first cemented in our minds.</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
filter(gapminder, year == 1962) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(fertility, life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point()
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Most points fall into two distinct categories:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><p>Life expectancy around 70 years and 3 or fewer children per family.</p></li>
            <li><p>Life expectancy lower than 65 years and more than 5 children per family.</p></li>
          </ol>

          <p>To confirm that indeed these countries are from the regions we expect, we can use color to represent continent.</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
filter(gapminder, year == 1962) |&gt;
  ggplot( aes(fertility, life_expectancy, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() 
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>In 1962, "the West versus developing world" view was grounded in some reality. Is this still the case 50 years later?</p>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-faceting">
          <title>Faceting</title>

          <p>We could easily plot the 2012 data in the same way we did for 1962. To make comparisons, however, side by side plots are preferable. In <alert>ggplot2</alert>, we can achieve this by <em>faceting</em> variables: we stratify the data by some variable and make the same plot for each strata.</p>

          <p>To achieve faceting, we add a layer with the function <c>facet_grid</c>, which automatically separates the plots. This function lets you facet by up to two variables using columns to represent one variable and rows to represent the other. The function expects the row and column variables to be separated by a <c>~</c>. Here is an example of a scatterplot with <c>facet_grid</c> added as the last layer:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
filter(gapminder, year %in% c(1962, 2012)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(year~continent)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>We see a plot for each continent/year pair. However, this is just an example and more than what we want, which is simply to compare 1962 and 2012. In this case, there is just one variable and we use <c>.</c> to let facet know that we are not using a second variable:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
filter(gapminder, year %in% c(1962, 2012)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>This plot clearly shows that the majority of countries have moved from the <em>developing world</em> cluster to the <em>western world</em> one. In 2012, the western versus developing world view no longer makes sense. This is particularly clear when comparing Europe to Asia, the latter of which includes several countries that have made great improvements.</p>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-facet-wrap">
            <title>`facet_wrap`</title>

            <p>To explore how this transformation happened through the years, we can make the plot for several years. For example, we can add 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. If we do this, we will not want all the plots on the same row, the default behavior of <c>facet_grid</c>, since they will become too thin to show the data. Instead, we will want to use multiple rows and columns. The function <c>facet_wrap</c> permits us to do this by automatically wrapping the series of plots so that each display has viewable dimensions:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
years &lt;- c(1962, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2012)
continents &lt;- c("Europe", "Asia")
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year %in% years &amp; continent %in% continents) |&gt;
  ggplot( aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~year) 
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>This plot clearly shows how most Asian countries have improved at a much faster rate than European ones.</p>

          </subsection>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-fixed-scales-for-better-comparisons">
            <title>Fixed scales for better comparisons</title>

            <p>The default choice of the range of the axes is important. When not using <c>facet</c>, this range is determined by the data shown in the plot. When using <c>facet</c>, this range is determined by the data shown in all plots and therefore kept fixed across plots. This makes comparisons across plots much easier. For example, in the above plot, we can see that life expectancy has increased and the fertility has decreased across most countries. We see this because the cloud of points moves. This is not the case if we adjust the scales:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
filter(gapminder, year %in% c(1962, 2012)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(fertility, life_expectancy, col = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(. ~ year, scales = "free")
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>In the plot above, we have to pay special attention to the range to notice that the plot on the right has a larger life expectancy.</p>

          </subsection>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-time-series-plots">
          <title>Time series plots</title>

          <p>The visualizations above effectively illustrate that data no longer supports the western versus developing world view. Once we see these plots, new questions emerge. For example, which countries are improving more and which ones less? Was the improvement constant during the last 50 years or was it more accelerated during certain periods? For a closer look that may help answer these questions, we introduce <em>time series plots</em>.</p>

          <p>Time series plots have time in the x-axis and an outcome or measurement of interest on the y-axis. For example, here is a trend plot of United States fertility rates:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(country == "United States") |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(year, fertility)) +
  geom_point()
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>We see that the trend is not linear at all. Instead there is sharp drop during the 1960s and 1970s to below 2. Then the trend comes back to 2 and stabilizes during the 1990s.</p>

          <p>When the points are regularly and densely spaced, as they are here, we create curves by joining the points with lines, to convey that these data are from a single series, here a country. To do this, we use the <c>geom_line</c> function instead of <c>geom_point</c>.</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(country == "United States") |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(year, fertility)) +
  geom_line()
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>This is particularly helpful when we look at two countries. We can subset the data to include two countries, one from Europe and one from Asia, then adapt the code above:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
countries &lt;- c("South Korea", "Germany")

gapminder |&gt; filter(country %in% countries) |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(year,fertility)) +
  geom_line()
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Unfortunately, this is <alert>not</alert> the plot that we want. Rather than a line for each country, the points for both countries are joined. This is actually expected since we have not told <c>ggplot</c> anything about wanting two separate lines. To let <c>ggplot</c> know that there are two curves that need to be made separately, we assign each point to a <c>group</c>, one for each country:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
countries &lt;- c("South Korea","Germany")

gapminder |&gt; filter(country %in% countries &amp; !is.na(fertility)) |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(year, fertility, group = country)) +
  geom_line()
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>But which line goes with which country? We can assign colors to make this distinction. A useful side-effect of using the <c>color</c> argument to assign different colors to the different countries is that the data is automatically grouped:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
countries &lt;- c("South Korea","Germany")
gapminder |&gt; filter(country %in% countries &amp; !is.na(fertility)) |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(year,fertility, col = country)) +
  geom_line()
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>The plot clearly shows how South Korea's fertility rate dropped drastically during the 1960s and 1970s, and by 1990 had a similar rate to that of Germany.</p>

          <p>For trend plots we recommend labeling the lines rather than using legends since the viewer can quickly see which line is which country. This suggestion actually applies to most plots: labeling is usually preferred over legends.</p>

          <p>We demonstrate how we can do this using the <c>geomtextpath</c> package. We define a data table with the label locations and then use a second mapping just for these labels:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
library(geomtextpath)
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(country %in% countries) |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, col = country, label = country)) +
  geom_textpath() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>The plot clearly shows how an improvement in life expectancy followed the drops in fertility rates. In 1960, Germans lived 15 years longer than South Koreans, although by 2010 the gap is completely closed. It exemplifies the improvement that many non-western countries have achieved in the last 40 years.</p>

        <section xml:id="sec-data-transformations">
          <title>Data transformations</title>

          <p>We now shift our attention to the second question related to the commonly held notion that wealth distribution across the world has become worse during the last decades. When general audiences are asked if poor countries have become poorer and rich countries become richer, the majority answers yes. By using stratification, histograms, smooth densities, and boxplots, we will be able to understand if this is in fact the case. First we learn how transformations can sometimes help provide more informative summaries and plots.</p>

          <p>The <c>gapminder</c> data table includes a column with the countries' gross domestic product (GDP). GDP measures the market value of goods and services produced by a country in a year. The GDP per person is often used as a rough summary of a country's wealth. Here we divide this quantity by 365 to obtain the more interpretable measure <em>dollars per day</em>. Using current US dollars as a unit, a person surviving on an income of less than $2 a day is defined to be living in <em>absolute poverty</em>. We add this variable to the data table:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
gapminder &lt;- gapminder |&gt;  
  mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>The GDP values are adjusted for inflation and represent current US dollars, so these values are meant to be comparable across the years. Of course, these are country averages and within each country there is much variability. All the graphs and insights described below relate to country averages and not to individuals.</p>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-log-transformation">
            <title>Log transformation</title>

            <p>Here is a histogram of per day incomes from 1970:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
past_year &lt;- 1970
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == past_year &amp; !is.na(gdp)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black")
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>We use the <c>color = "black"</c> argument to draw a boundary and clearly distinguish the bins.</p>

            <p>In this plot, we see that for the majority of countries, averages are below 10 dollars a day. However, the majority of the x-axis is dedicated to countries with averages above 10 dollars. So the plot is not very informative about countries with values below 10 dollars a day.</p>

            <p>It might be more informative to quickly be able to see how many countries have average daily incomes of about 1 dollar (extremely poor), 2 dollars (very poor), 4 dollars (poor), 8 dollars (middle), 16 dollars (well off), 32 dollars (rich), 64 dollars (very rich) per day. These changes are multiplicative, and log transformations convert multiplicative changes into additive ones: when using base 2, a doubling of a value turns into an increase by 1.</p>

            <p>Here is the distribution if we apply a log base 2 transform:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == past_year &amp; !is.na(gdp)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(log2(dollars_per_day))) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black")
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>In a way, this provides a <em>close-up</em> of the mid to lower income countries.</p>

          </subsection>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-which-base">
            <title>Which base?</title>

            <p>In the case above, we used base 2 in the log transformations. Other common choices are base <m>\mathrm{e}</m> (the natural log) and base 10.</p>

            <p>In general, we do not recommend using the natural log for data exploration and visualization. This is because while <m>2^2, 2^3, 2^4, \dots</m> or <m>10^2, 10^3, \dots</m> are easy to mentally compute, but the same is not true for <m>\mathrm{e}^2, \mathrm{e}^3, \dots</m>. The natural log scale is not intuitive or easy to interpret.</p>

            <p>In the dollars per day example, we used base 2 instead of base 10 because the resulting range is easier to interpret. The range of the untransformed values is <c>with(filter(gapminder, year==past_year), range(dollars_per_day, na.rm=TRUE))</c>.</p>

            <p>In base 10, this turns into a range that includes very few integers: just 0 and 1. With base 2, our range includes -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is easier to compute <m>2^x</m> and <m>10^x</m> when <m>x</m> is an integer and between -10 and 10, so we prefer to have smaller integers in the scale. Another consequence of a limited range is that choosing the binwidth is more challenging. With log base 2, we know that a binwidth of 1 will translate to a bin with range <m>x</m> to <m>2x</m>.</p>

            <p>For an example in which base 10 makes more sense, consider population sizes. A log base 10 is preferable since the range for these is:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
filter(gapminder, year == past_year) |&gt;
  summarize(min = min(population), max = max(population))
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Here is the histogram of the transformed values:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == past_year) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(log10(population))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = "black")
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>In the above, we quickly see that country populations range between ten thousand and ten billion.</p>

            <p>There are two ways we can use log transformations in plots. We can log the values before plotting them or use log scales in the axes. The plot will look the same,  except for the numbers in the axes. Both approaches are useful and have different strengths. If we log the data, we can more easily interpret intermediate values in the scale. For example, if we see:</p>

            <p><c>----1----x----2--------3----</c></p>

            <p>for log transformed data, we know that the value of <m>x</m> is about 1.5. If the scales are logged:</p>

            <p><c>----10---x---100------1000---</c></p>

            <p>then, to determine <c>x</c>, we need to compute <m>10^{1.5}</m>, which is not easy to do in our heads. However, the advantage of showing logged scales is that the original values are displayed in the plot, which are easier to interpret. For example, we would see "32 dollars a day" instead of "5 log base 2 dollars a day".</p>

            <p>As we learned earlier, if we want to scale the axis with logs, we can use the <c>scale_x_continuous</c> function. Instead of logging the values first, we apply this layer:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == past_year &amp; !is.na(gdp)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2")
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Note that the log base 10 transformation has its own function: <c>scale_x_log10()</c>, but currently base 2 does not, although we could easily define our own.</p>

            <p>There are other transformations available through the <c>trans</c> argument. As we learn later on, the square root (<c>sqrt</c>) transformation is useful when considering counts. The logistic transformation (<c>logit</c>) is useful when plotting proportions between 0 and 1. The <c>reverse</c> transformation is useful when we want smaller values to be on the right or on top.</p>

          <p>In the histogram above we see two <em>bumps</em>: one at about 4 and another at about 32. In statistics these bumps are sometimes referred to as <em>modes</em>. The mode of a distribution is the value with the highest frequency. The mode of the normal distribution is the average. When a distribution, like the one above, doesn't monotonically decrease from the mode, we call the locations where it goes up and down again <em>local modes</em> and say that the distribution has <em>multiple modes</em>.</p>

          <p>The histogram above suggests that the 1970 country income distribution has two modes: one at about 2 dollars per day (1 in the log 2 scale) and another at about 32 dollars per day (5 in the log 2 scale). This <em>bimodality</em> is consistent with a dichotomous world made up of countries with average incomes less than 8 dollars per day (3 in the log 2 scale) and countries above that.</p>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-comparing-distributions">
          <title>Comparing distributions</title>

          <p>A histogram showed us that the 1970 income distribution values show a dichotomy. However, the histogram does not show us if the two groups of countries are <em>west</em> versus the <em>developing</em> world.</p>

          <p>Let's start by quickly examining the data by region. We reorder the regions by the median value and use a log scale.</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == past_year &amp; !is.na(gdp)) |&gt;
  mutate(region = reorder(region, dollars_per_day, FUN = median)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, region)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2")  
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>We can already see that there is indeed a "west versus the rest" dichotomy: we see two clear groups, with the rich group composed of North America, Northern and Western Europe, and New Zealand and Australia. We define groups based on this observation:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
gapminder &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  mutate(group = case_when(
    region %in% c("Western Europe", "Northern Europe","Southern Europe", 
                    "Northern America", 
                  "Australia and New Zealand") ~ "West",
    region %in% c("Eastern Asia", "South-Eastern Asia") ~ "East Asia",
    region %in% c("Caribbean", "Central America", 
                  "South America") ~ "Latin America",
    continent == "Africa" &amp; 
      region != "Northern Africa" ~ "Sub-Saharan",
    TRUE ~ "Others"))
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>We turn this <c>group</c> variable into a factor to control the order of the levels:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
gapminder &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  mutate(group = factor(group, levels = c("Others", "Latin America", 
                                          "East Asia", "Sub-Saharan",
                                          "West")))
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>In the next section we demonstrate how to visualize and compare distributions across groups.</p>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-boxplots">
            <title>Boxplots</title>

            <p>The exploratory data analysis above has revealed two characteristics about average income distribution in 1970. Using a histogram, we found a bimodal distribution with the modes relating to poor and rich countries. We now want to compare the distribution across these five groups to confirm the "west versus the rest" dichotomy. The number of points in each category is large enough that a summary plot may be useful. We could generate five histograms or five density plots, but it may be more practical to have all the visual summaries in one plot. We therefore start by stacking boxplots next to each other. Note that we add the layer <c>theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))</c> to turn the group labels vertical, since they do not fit if we show them horizontally, and we remove the axis label to make space.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
p &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == past_year &amp; !is.na(gdp)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(group, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  xlab("") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) 
p
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Boxplots have the limitation that by summarizing the data into five numbers, we might miss important characteristics of the data. One way to avoid this is by showing the data.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
              </input>
            </program>

          </subsection>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-ridge-plots">
            <title>Ridge plots</title>

            <p>Showing each individual point does not always reveal important characteristics of the distribution. Although not the case here, when the number of data points is so large that there is over-plotting, showing the data can be counterproductive. Boxplots help with this by providing a five-number summary, but this has limitations too. For example, boxplots will not permit us to discover bimodal distributions. To see this, note that the two plots below are summarizing the same dataset:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
set.seed(1987)
z &lt;- sample(c(0,1), 1000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.25, 0.75))
x &lt;- rnorm(100)*z + rnorm(100, 5)*(1 - z)
p1 &lt;- data.frame(x=x) |&gt; 
  ggplot(aes(x)) + 
  geom_density(fill = 1, show.legend=FALSE, alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-4,8.5))
p2 &lt;- data.frame(g= "", x=x) |&gt; ggplot(aes(g, x)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("") +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank())
  
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>In cases in which we are concerned that the boxplot summary is too simplistic, we can show stacked smooth densities or histograms. We refer to these as <em>ridge plots</em>. Because we are used to visualizing densities with values in the x-axis, we stack them vertically. Also, because more space is needed in this approach, it is convenient to overlay them. The package <alert>ggridges</alert> provides a convenient function for doing this. Here is the income data shown above with boxplots but with a <em>ridge plot</em>.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
library(ggridges)
p &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year == past_year &amp; !is.na(dollars_per_day)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, group)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") 
p  + geom_density_ridges() 
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Note that we have to invert the <c>x</c> and <c>y</c> used for the boxplot. A useful <c>geom_density_ridges</c> parameter is <c>scale</c>, which lets you determine the amount of overlap, with <c>scale = 1</c> meaning no overlap and larger values resulting in more overlap.</p>

            <p>If the number of data points is small enough, we can add them to the ridge plot using the following code:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
p + geom_density_ridges(jittered_points = TRUE)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>By default, the height of the points is jittered and should not be interpreted in any way. To show data points, but without using jitter we can use the following code to add what is referred to as a <em>rug representation</em> of the data.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
p + geom_density_ridges(jittered_points = TRUE, 
                        position = position_points_jitter(height = 0),
                        point_shape = '|', point_size = 3, 
                        point_alpha = 1, alpha = 0.7)
              </input>
            </program>

          </subsection>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-example-1970-versus-2010-income-distributions">
            <title>Example: 1970 versus 2010 income distributions</title>

            <p>Data exploration clearly shows that in 1970 there was a "west versus the rest" dichotomy. But does this dichotomy persist? Let's use <c>facet_grid</c> and see how the distributions have changed. To start, we will focus on two groups: the west and the rest. We make four histograms. We make this plot only for countries with data in both 1970 and 2010. Note that several countries were founded after 1970; for example, the Soviet Union divided into several countries during the 1990s. We also note that that data was available for more countries in 2010.</p>

            <p>We therefore make the plot only for countries with data in both years:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
past_year &lt;- 1970
present_year &lt;- 2010
years &lt;- c(past_year, present_year)
country_list &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year %in% c(present_year, past_year)) |&gt;
  group_by(country) |&gt;
  summarize(n = sum(!is.na(dollars_per_day)), .groups = "drop") |&gt;
  filter(n == 2) |&gt;
  pull(country)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>These <c>length(country_list)</c> countries account for <c>round(gapminder |> filter(year==present_year) |> summarize(perc=sum(population[country%in%country_list], na.rm=TRUE)/sum(population, na.rm=TRUE)) |> pull(perc)*100 )</c>% of the world population, so this subset should be representative. We can compare the distributions using this code:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year %in% years &amp; country %in% country_list) |&gt;
  mutate(west = ifelse(group == "West", "West", "Developing")) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  facet_grid(year ~ west)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>We now see that the rich countries have become a bit richer, but percentage-wise, the poor countries appear to have improved more. In particular, we see that the proportion of <em>developing</em> countries earning more than $16 a day increased substantially.</p>

            <p>To see which specific regions improved the most, we can remake the boxplots we made above, but now adding the year 2010 and then using facet to compare the two years.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year %in% years &amp; country %in% country_list) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(group, dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  xlab("") +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Here, we pause to introduce another powerful <alert>ggplot2</alert> feature. Because we want to compare each region before and after, it would be convenient to have the <c>past_year</c> boxplot next to the <c>present_year</c> boxplot for each region. In general, comparisons are easier when data are plotted next to each other.</p>

            <p>So instead of faceting, we keep the data from each year together and ask to color (or fill) them depending on the year. Note that groups are automatically separated by year and each pair of boxplots drawn next to each other. Because the year column is a number, we have to convert it into a factor since <alert>ggplot2</alert> automatically assigns a color to each category of a factor.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year %in% years &amp; country %in% country_list) |&gt;
  mutate(year = factor(year)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(group, dollars_per_day, fill = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
  xlab("") 
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>The previous data exploration suggested that the income gap between rich and poor countries has narrowed considerably during the last 40 years. We used a series of histograms and boxplots to see this. We suggest a succinct way to convey this message with just one plot.</p>

            <p>Let's start by noting that density plots for income distribution in <c>past_year</c> and <c>present_year</c> deliver the message that the gap is closing:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year %in% years &amp; country %in% country_list) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) +
  geom_density(fill = "grey") + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>In the <c>past_year</c> plot, we see two clear modes: poor and rich countries. In <c>present_year</c>, it appears that some of the poor countries have shifted towards the right, closing the gap.</p>

            <p>The next message we need to convey is that the reason for this change in distribution is that several poor countries became richer, rather than some rich countries becoming poorer. To do this, we can assign a color to the groups we identified during data exploration.</p>

            <p>However, because when we overlay two densities, the default is to have the area under the distribution curve add up to 1 for each group, regardless of the size of each group, we first need to learn how to make these smooth densities in a way that preserves information on the number of countries in each group. To do this, we will need to learn to access computed variables with the <c>geom_density</c> function.</p>

          </subsection>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-accessing-computed-variables">
            <title>Accessing computed variables</title>

            <p>To have the areas of these densities be proportional to the size of the groups, we can simply multiply the y-axis values by the size of the group. From the <c>geom_density</c> help file, we see that the functions compute a variable called <c>count</c> that does exactly this. We want this variable to be on the y-axis rather than the density.</p>

            <p>In <alert>ggplot2</alert>, we access these variables using the function <c>after_stat</c>. We will therefore use the following mapping:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
aes(x = dollars_per_day, y = after_stat(count))
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>We can now create the desired plot by simply changing the mapping in the previous code chunk. We will also expand the limits of the x-axis.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
p &lt;- gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year %in% years &amp; country %in% country_list) |&gt;
  mutate(group = ifelse(group == "West", "West", "Developing")) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, y = after_stat(count), fill = group)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limits = c(0.125, 300))
p + geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + facet_grid(year ~ .)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>If we want the densities to be smoother, we use the <c>bw</c> argument so that the same bandwidth is used in each density. We selected 0.75 after trying out several values.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
p + geom_density(alpha = 0.2, bw = 0.75) + facet_grid(year ~ .)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>This plot now shows what is happening very clearly. The developing world distribution is changing. A third mode appears consisting of the countries that most narrowed the gap.</p>

            <p>To visualize if any of the groups defined above are driving this we can quickly make a ridge plot:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year %in% years &amp; !is.na(dollars_per_day)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, group)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  geom_density_ridges(bandwidth = 1.5) +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Another way to achieve this is by stacking the densities on top of each other:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
    filter(year %in% years &amp; country %in% country_list) |&gt;
  group_by(year) |&gt;
  mutate(weight = population/sum(population)*2) |&gt;
  ungroup() |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, fill = group)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limits = c(0.125, 300)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, bw = 0.75, position = "stack") + 
  facet_grid(year ~ .) 
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Here we can clearly see how the distributions for East Asia, Latin America, and others shift markedly to the right while Sub-Saharan Africa remains stagnant.</p>

            <p>Notice that we order the levels of the group so that the West's density is plotted first, then Sub-Saharan Africa. Having the two extremes plotted first allows us to see the remaining bimodality better.</p>

          </subsection>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-weighted-densities">
            <title>Weighted densities</title>

            <p>As a final point, we note that these distributions weigh every country the same. So if most of the population is improving, but living in a very large country, such as China, we might not appreciate this. We can actually weight the smooth densities using the <c>weight</c> mapping argument. The plot then looks like this:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
gapminder |&gt; 
  filter(year %in% years &amp; country %in% country_list) |&gt;
  group_by(year) |&gt;
  mutate(weight = population/sum(population)*2) |&gt;
  ungroup() |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, fill = group, weight = weight)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limits = c(0.125, 300)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, bw = 0.75, position = "stack") + facet_grid(year ~ .) 
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>This particular figure shows very clearly how the income distribution gap is closing with most of the poor remaining in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

          <p>The relationship between these two variables is almost perfectly linear with the chosen axis transformations, and the graph shows a dramatic difference. While in the West less than 0.5% of infants die, in Sub-Saharan Africa the rate is higher than 6%!</p>

          <p>Note that the plot uses a new transformation, the logistic transformation.</p>

          <subsection xml:id="sec-logit">
            <title>Logistic transformation</title>

            <p>The logistic or logit transformation for a proportion or rate <m>p</m> is defined as:</p>

            <me>
f(p) = \log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right)
            </me>

            <p>When <m>p</m> is a proportion or probability, the quantity that is being logged, <m>p/(1-p)</m>, is called the <em>odds</em>. In this case <m>p</m> is the proportion of infants that survived. The odds tell us how many more infants are expected to survive than to die. The log transformation makes this symmetric. If the rates are the same, then the log odds is 0. Fold increases or decreases turn into positive and negative increments, respectively.</p>

            <p>This scale is useful when we want to highlight differences near 0 or 1. For survival rates this is important because a survival rate of 90% is unacceptable, while a survival of 99% is relatively good. We would much prefer a survival rate closer to 99.9%. We want our scale to highlight these difference and the logit does this. Note that 99.9/0.1 is about 10 times bigger than 99/1 which is about 10 times larger than 90/10. By using the log, these fold changes turn into constant increases.</p>

            <p>Now, back to our plot. Based on the plot above, do we conclude that a country with a low income is destined to have low survival rate? Do we conclude that survival rates in Sub-Saharan Africa are all lower than in Southern Asia, which in turn are lower than in the Pacific Islands, and so on?</p>

            <p>Jumping to this conclusion based on a plot showing averages is referred to as the <em>ecological fallacy</em>. The almost perfect relationship between survival rates and income is only observed for the averages at the region level. Once we show all the data, we see a somewhat more complicated story:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
library(ggrepel)
highlight &lt;- c("Sierra Leone", "Mauritius",  "Sudan", "Botswana", "Tunisia",
               "Cambodia","Singapore","Chile", "Haiti", "Bolivia",
               "United States","Sweden", "Angola", "Serbia")

gapminder |&gt; filter(year %in% present_year &amp; !is.na(gdp) &amp; !is.na(infant_mortality) &amp; !is.na(group) ) |&gt;
  mutate(country_name = ifelse(country %in% highlight, as.character(country), "")) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, 1 - infant_mortality/1000, col = group, label = country_name)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limits = c(0.25, 150)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "logit",limits = c(0.875, .9981),
                     breaks = c(.85,.90,.95,.99,.995,.998)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel(size = 4, show.legend = FALSE)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>Specifically, we see that there is a large amount of variability. We see that countries from the same regions can be quite different and that countries with the same income can have different survival rates. For example, while on average Sub-Saharan Africa had the worse health and economic outcomes, there is wide variability within that group. Mauritius and Botswana are doing better than Angola and Sierra Leone, with Mauritius comparable to Western countries.</p>

          <title>Case study 3: vaccines and infectious diseases</title>

          <p>Vaccines have helped save millions of lives. In the 19th century, before herd immunization was achieved through vaccination programs, deaths from infectious diseases, such as smallpox and polio, were common. Today however, vaccination programs have become somewhat controversial despite all the scientific evidence for their importance.</p>

          <p>The controversy started with a paper published in 1988 and led by Andrew Wakefield claiming there was a link between the administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the appearance of autism and bowel disease. Despite much scientific evidence contradicting this finding, sensationalist media reports and fear-mongering from conspiracy theorists led parts of the public into believing that vaccines were harmful. As a result, many parents ceased to vaccinate their children. This dangerous practice can be potentially disastrous given that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that vaccinations will prevent more than 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the last 20 years (see Benefits from Immunization during the Vaccines for Children Program Era — United States, 1994-2013, MMWR). The 1988 paper has since been retracted and Andrew Wakefield was eventually "struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and was thereby barred from practicing medicine in the UK." (source: Wikipedia). Yet misconceptions persist, in part due to self-proclaimed activists who continue to disseminate misinformation about vaccines.</p>

          <p>Effective communication of data is a strong antidote to misinformation and fear-mongering. In the introduction to this part of the book we showed an example, provided by a Wall Street Journal article, showing data related to the impact of vaccines on battling infectious diseases.  Here we reconstruct that example.</p>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-vaccine-data">
            <title>Vaccine data</title>

            <p>The data used for these plots were collected, organized, and distributed by the Tycho Project. They include weekly reported counts for seven diseases from 1928 to 2011, from all fifty states. We include the yearly totals in the __dslabs__ package:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(dslabs)
names(us_contagious_diseases)
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>We create a temporary object <c>dat</c> that stores only the measles data, includes a per 100,000 rate, orders states by average value of disease and removes Alaska and Hawaii since they only became states in the late 1950s. Note that there is a <c>weeks_reporting</c> column that tells us for how many weeks of the year data was reported. We have to adjust for that value when computing the rate.</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
the_disease &lt;- "Measles"
dat &lt;- us_contagious_diseases |&gt;
  filter(!state %in% c("Hawaii","Alaska") &amp; disease == the_disease) |&gt;
  mutate(rate = count / population * 10000 * 52 / weeks_reporting) |&gt; 
  mutate(state = reorder(state, ifelse(year &lt;= 1963, rate, NA), 
                         median, na.rm = TRUE)) 
              </input>
            </program>

          </subsection>

          <subsection xml:id="subsec-trend-plots">
            <title>Trend plots</title>

            <p>We can now easily plot disease rates per year. Here are the measles data from California:</p>

            <program language="r">
              <input>
dat |&gt; filter(state == "California" &amp; !is.na(rate)) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(year, rate)) +
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("Cases per 10,000")  + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1963, col = "blue")
              </input>
            </program>

            <p>We add a vertical line at 1963 since this is when the vaccine was introduced .</p>

          </subsection>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-heatmaps">
          <title>Heatmaps</title>

          <p>Now can we show data for all states in one plot? We have three variables to show: year, state, and rate. In the WSJ figure, they use the x-axis for year, the y-axis for state, and color hue to represent rates. However, the color scale they use, which goes from yellow to blue to green to orange to red, can be improved.</p>

          <p>In our example, we want to use a sequential palette since there is no meaningful center, just low and high rates.</p>

          <p>We use the geometry <c>geom_tile</c> to tile the region with colors representing disease rates. We use a square root transformation to avoid having the really high counts dominate the plot. Notice that missing values are shown in grey. Note that once a disease was pretty much eradicated, some states stopped reporting cases all together. This is why we see so much grey after 1980.</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
dat |&gt; ggplot(aes(year, state, fill = rate)) +
  geom_tile(color = "grey50") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9, "Reds"), trans = "sqrt") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1963, col = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +  
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        legend.position = "bottom", 
        text = element_text(size = 8)) +
  labs(title = the_disease, x = "", y = "")
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>This plot makes a very striking argument for the contribution of vaccines. However, one limitation of this plot is that it uses color to represent quantity, which we earlier explained makes it harder to know exactly how high values are going. Position and lengths are better cues. If we are willing to lose state information, we can make a version of the plot that shows the values with position. We can also show the average for the US, which we compute like this:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
avg &lt;- us_contagious_diseases |&gt;
  filter(disease == the_disease) |&gt; group_by(year) |&gt;
  summarize(us_rate = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE) / 
              sum(population, na.rm = TRUE) * 10000)
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>Now to make the plot we simply use the <c>geom_line</c> geometry:</p>

          <program language="r">
            <input>
dat |&gt; 
  filter(!is.na(rate)) |&gt;
    ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(year, rate, group = state),  color = "grey50", 
            show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.2, linewidth = 1) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(year, us_rate),  data = avg, linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "sqrt", breaks = c(5, 25, 125, 300)) + 
  ggtitle("Cases per 10,000 by state") + 
  xlab("") + ylab("") +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 1955, y = 50), 
            mapping = aes(x, y, label = "US average"), 
            color = "black") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1963, col = "blue")
            </input>
          </program>

          <p>In theory, we could use color to represent the categorical value state, but it is hard to pick 50 distinct colors.</p>

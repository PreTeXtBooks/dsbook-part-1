        This book is dedicated to all the people involved in building and maintaining R and the R packages we use in this book. A special thanks to the developers and maintainers of base R, the tidyverse, data.table, and the caret package.

        A special thanks to Jenna Landy for her careful editing and helpful advice on this book; to David Robinson for generously answering many questions about the tidyverse and aiding in my understanding of it; and to Amy Gill for dozens of comments, edits, and suggestions. Also, many thanks to Stephanie Hicks who twice served as a co-instructor in my data science classes and Yihui Xie who patiently put up with my many questions related to markdown. Thanks also to Karl Broman, from whom I borrowed ideas for the Data Visualization and Productivity Tools parts. Thanks to Peter Aldhous from whom I borrowed ideas for the principles of data visualization section and Jenny Bryan for writing <em>Happy Git and GitHub for the useR</em>, which influenced our Git chapters. Also, many thanks to Jeff Leek, Roger Peng, and Brian Caffo, whose online classes inspired the way this book is divided, to Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham for making the markdown code for their R for Data Science book open, and the editors, John Kimmel and Lara Spieker, for their support. Finally, thanks to Alex Nones for proofreading the manuscript during its various stages.

        This book was conceived during the teaching of several applied statistics courses, starting over fifteen years ago. The teaching assistants working with me throughout the years made important indirect contributions to this book. The material was further refined during a HarvardX series coordinated by Heather Sternshein and Zofia Gajdos. We thank them for their contributions. We are also grateful to all the students whose questions and comments helped us improve the book. The courses were partially funded by NIH grant R25GM114818. We are very grateful to the National Institutes of Health for its support.
